- Hi, I’m @theoteno
- I’m interested in developing FOSS android & linux tools with gtk4

My first linux app will be Claps, a gtk4 (gnome) audio editor.

I started playing with the idea after Audacity added telemetry without opt-out,
 and made some changes that were limiting who could use it at all(age restriction).

Since then I used KWave(sound editor), but I kind of hated the yellow/blue select highlight.

And near this October I saw 2 issues (2009,2014), both asking for simple filters in Gnome Sound Recorder.

Pitivi could be used for audio editing, but it's more of a video editor.
And simply 9 of 10 users would recommend it for editing videos, most likely.

LMMS or Zrythm might could be good for this kind of use, but these type of programs[DAW] are having layouts for music production. (also, they can be complicated & scary to some of the new users.)

For now, that's what I want to get started with.

I'd be happy to find an newer alternative for MusicId. For mobile I couldn't find any, but Tagger is a great gtk4 app for music tag editing on desktop.

- I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- How to reach me ...
