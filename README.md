- Hi, I’m @theoteno
- I’m interested in developing FOSS android & linux tools with Gtk4

My first linux app will be Claps, a gtk4 (gnome) audio editor.

I started playing with the idea after Audacity added telemetry without opt-out,
 and made some changes that were limiting who could use it at all(age restriction).

Since then I used KWave(sound editor), but I kind of hated the yellow/blue select highlight.

And near this October I saw 2 issues (2009,2014), both asking for simple filters.
For now, that's what I want to get started with.

- I’m currently learning: Python
- I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- How to reach me ...
