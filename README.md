- Hi, I’m @theoteno
- I’m interested in developing FOSS Android & Linux tools with Gtk4

My first linux app will be Claps, a Gtk4 (Gnome) audio editor.

I started playing with the idea after Audacity added telemetry without opt-out,
 and made some changes that were limiting who could use it at all(age restriction).

Since then I used KWave(sound editor), but I kind of hate the yellow/blue select highlight.

And in October of 2022 I saw 2 issues (2009, 2014), both asking for simple filters in Gnome Sound Recorder.

Pitivi could be used for audio editing, but it's more of a video editor.
And simply 9 of 10 users would recommend it for editing videos, most likely.

LMMS or Zrythm might could be good for this kind of use, but these Digital Audio Workstations are having layouts for music production. (also, they can be complicated & scary to some of the new users.)

For now, that's what I want to get started with.

I'd be happy to find an newer alternative for MusicId. For mobile I couldn't find any, but Tagger is a great Gtk4 app for music tag editing on desktop.
